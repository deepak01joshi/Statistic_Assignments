It provides information about the distribution of data, including symmetry, skewness, variance, and potential outliers.\n",
        "Key Features of a Box Plot:\n",
        "Box:\n",
        "The box itself represents the interquartile range (IQR), which is the difference between the first and third quartiles (Q3 - Q1). It shows the middle 50% of the data.\n",
        "Whiskers:\n",
        "Lines that extend from the box to the minimum and maximum values (excluding outliers). They indicate the spread of the data outside the IQR.\n",

        "What a Box Plot Tells You:\n",
        "Central Tendency:\n",
        "The median provides a measure of the center of the data.\n",
        "Spread:\n",
        "The IQR shows how spread out the middle 50% of the data is. The range (maximum - minimum) shows the total spread of the data.\n",
        "Skewness:\n",
        "If the median line is not in the center of the box, it indicates skewness in the data distribution. For example, if the median is closer to the lower edge of the box, the data is skewed to the right.\n",
        "Outliers:\n",
        "Box plots help identify potential outliers, data points that fall outside the normal range.\n",
        "Comparison:\n",
        "Box plots are useful for comparing the distributions of multiple data sets, as they allow you to visually compare the medians, quartiles, and spread of different groups.\n",

        ">>Answer: Random sampling plays a crucial role in inferential statistics, allowing researchers to make generalizations about a larger population based on data collected from a smaller, representative sample. By ensuring every member of the population has an equal chance of being selected, random sampling reduces bias and increases the likelihood of obtaining accurate and reliable results. This, in turn, allows for stronger statistical inferences and predictions about the population as a whole.\n",

There are three main types of skewness: positive (right), negative (left), and zero (symmetric). Skewness affects data interpretation by influencing the relationship between the mean, median, and mode, and can also highlight the presence of outliers.\n",

It's calculated by subtracting the first quartile (Q1) from the third quartile (Q3): IQR = Q3 - Q1. The IQR is used to identify potential outliers by setting \"fences\" (Q1 - 1.5IQR and Q3 + 1.5IQR) and defining any data points outside these fences as outliers.\n",
